# file scanner:

  download & open it,you will get a Debug folder with GameBus.exe & example.cpp in it.
  GameBus.exe was born for generating specific gb project.It can configurate the example.txt file stored at the same folder level
  example.txt is for code fevers while it can proceed and describe functional widgets and rectangles with rigidbodys,several sensive coordination detectors,crash detectors, motion measures,and of cource,effective solutions which just run at an elegant way.
-soucecode.cpp
  to consider all these above as a full-path code!
  
# Advances:
still a effective game engine needs minimal UIs ,but it doesnt means that an engine do this a little bit ahead cant satisfy our users ,vice versa.The only-rects-UI can concentrate developers on promoting algorithms and coherence of the code and their context.Which means the saved performance can be dedicated for alternative expections.
